This is current version of SING-master prototype for android.

Pitch extraction works with AMDF alg from
http://0110.be/posts/TarsosDSP_on_Android_-_Audio_Processing_in_Java_on_Android
(PitchDetector example here: https://github.com/srubin/TarsosDSP)

-----------------------------------------
STATUS:
recording from mic works. pitch extraction works and is done realtime. 
tested under API LEVEL 16 (4.1) with device emulator

IMPORTANT: 
we are using sample rate 8k which only supports in emulator. In device use samplerate to 44.1k for better quality.

SUPPORT for API LEVEL: 
DialogFragment (class MessageDialog) requires API 11.

-------------------------------------------------

DEBUGING: 
To have impression of real-time speed do "run" instead of "debug"
if virtual devices does not start from eclipse, do: 
shell> emulator -avd AVD4.1
or
Eclipse-> virtual device manager -> start AVD4.1 -> mark "wipe user data" on Launch Setting   

if emulator starts, but cannot be detected as running on subsequent launches do: 
adb start-server


The connection to adb is down, and a severe error has occured: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4072706/the-connection-to-adb-is-down-and-a-severe-error-has-occured

after stopping by runtim exception, always kill app on device before relaunch. It does not automatically gets restarted

to kill on emulator app do: 
adb shell ps
adb shell kill <psNUm>

to kill android app:
Setttings -> Applications -> ManageApplications -> type app name force close 

could not get audio input for record source 1: 

make sure permission in manifest is OK
(if error thrown on record, not on init:) record size should be more than minBUffSize 
project clean
kill running app
restart phone
 

PROBLEMS: 


GUI  animation works but timing of color bars is not precise. it has not set priority: only runOnUiThread()
 audio recording thread has setThreadPriority(URGENT_AUDIO)



TarsosDSP is VEEEERY slow!
