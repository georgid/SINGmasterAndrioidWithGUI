		WORKPLAN:

tempo slider to work



------------------------
SECONDARY : 


2) test under different processors. 
Use logic from singMaster and put in com.kamenâ€¦ 

prepare code to count time. 
take from bg.singmaster.backend.AudioProcessor.AudioProcessingThread
- first see problem with timing, not reset after each BufferLength.

how much Mhz are needed to ensure realtime recording with at most 3 seconds lag? 


 


- test with Yin instead. 


5) no hopping of windows . add hops 

5.5) FLAW: if  pitch extraction faster than recording, then Queue might be emptied before recording finished! 

6) each exercise to be stored as a textFile which can be loaded in a separate class ExerciseLoader. It will be used in OnRecordListener()
move int numNotes = 3; from OnRecordListener to ParametersExercise

7) increase and test different buffer sizes. small buffer sizes might mean chances of not smooth reading
